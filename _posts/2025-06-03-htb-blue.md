### üß† Why This Happens:
The `so-simple-theme` automatically shows your blog posts as clean boxes/cards on the home page. If there are **no posts**, it shows nothing except the header/footer.

If you want me to send you a full working `.zip` structure with:
- `_posts/`
- sample post
- working config
- clean layout

Just say:  
**‚ÄúYes, send me the starter blog zip for ReconWatch‚Äù**.
